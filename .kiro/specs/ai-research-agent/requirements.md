# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a fullstack AI Agent application that serves as a research expert. The system will accept research requirements from users and conduct comprehensive research by gathering information from multiple academic sources including Google Scholar, Google Books, and ScienceDirect. The application uses a microservices architecture with NextJS frontend, FastAPI backend with AI model integration, and MongoDB for prompt caching to optimize performance.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to submit a research topic or requirement to the AI agent, so that I can receive comprehensive research findings from multiple academic sources.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a research query THEN the system SHALL accept the input and initiate the research process
2. WHEN the research process begins THEN the system SHALL search Google Scholar, Google Books, and ScienceDirect simultaneously
3. WHEN research is complete THEN the system SHALL present consolidated findings to the user
4. IF the research query is empty or invalid THEN the system SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the application through a modern web interface, so that I can easily submit research requests and view results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the application THEN the system SHALL display a NextJS-based frontend interface
2. WHEN a user submits a research request THEN the frontend SHALL communicate with the backend microservice
3. WHEN research results are available THEN the frontend SHALL display them in a readable format
4. IF the backend is unavailable THEN the frontend SHALL display appropriate error messages

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the AI processing to be handled by a dedicated microservice, so that the system can scale efficiently and maintain separation of concerns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the frontend sends a research request THEN the FastAPI microservice SHALL receive and process it
2. WHEN the AI model processes the request THEN the system SHALL integrate findings from all three sources
3. WHEN processing is complete THEN the FastAPI service SHALL return structured results to the frontend
4. IF any external API fails THEN the system SHALL continue with available sources and log the failure

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system user, I want the application to cache previous research queries, so that repeated or similar requests can be served faster and reduce API costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a research query is processed THEN the system SHALL store the query and results in MongoDB
2. WHEN a similar query is submitted THEN the system SHALL check the cache first before making new API calls
3. WHEN cached results are found THEN the system SHALL return them immediately
4. WHEN cached results are older than a defined threshold THEN the system SHALL refresh the cache with new research

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access information from Google Scholar, so that I can gather academic papers and citations relevant to my research topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system searches Google Scholar THEN it SHALL retrieve relevant academic papers
2. WHEN papers are found THEN the system SHALL extract titles, authors, abstracts, and citation information
3. WHEN no papers are found THEN the system SHALL log this and continue with other sources
4. IF Google Scholar API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access books from Google Books, so that I can find comprehensive book resources related to my research topic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system searches Google Books THEN it SHALL retrieve relevant book information
2. WHEN books are found THEN the system SHALL extract titles, authors, descriptions, and publication details
3. WHEN preview content is available THEN the system SHALL include relevant excerpts
4. IF Google Books API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to access papers from ScienceDirect, so that I can gather scientific publications from Elsevier's database.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system searches ScienceDirect THEN it SHALL retrieve relevant scientific papers
2. WHEN papers are found THEN the system SHALL extract titles, authors, abstracts, and DOI information
3. WHEN access restrictions apply THEN the system SHALL indicate availability status
4. IF ScienceDirect API limits are reached THEN the system SHALL handle rate limiting gracefully

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle errors gracefully, so that users receive meaningful feedback when issues occur.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any external API fails THEN the system SHALL log the error and continue processing
2. WHEN database operations fail THEN the system SHALL retry with exponential backoff
3. WHEN critical errors occur THEN the system SHALL return appropriate HTTP status codes
4. WHEN partial results are available THEN the system SHALL return them with status indicators

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the system to be properly structured with microservices architecture, so that it can be maintained and scaled effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the frontend SHALL run as a separate NextJS microservice
2. WHEN the system is deployed THEN the AI backend SHALL run as a separate FastAPI microservice
3. WHEN services communicate THEN they SHALL use well-defined REST API endpoints
4. WHEN the system scales THEN each microservice SHALL be independently scalable
